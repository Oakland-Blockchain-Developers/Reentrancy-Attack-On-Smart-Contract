# Pristine

Pristine is an open source repository in its original condition.

There are a lack of repositories to start from to build community driven open source projects. Pristine is a starting point, it follows a Documentation Driven Development approach, and can be used as a resource to augment existing documentation.

## How to use Pristine in your project

There are 2 options for using pristine with your project. 
1. Fork this repo as the start of your own, OR
2. [follow these instructions](https://thoughts.t37.net/merging-2-different-git-repositories-without-losing-your-history-de7a06bba804) to use it on an existing repository.

## Documentation Driven Development

There are many ways to drive open source development. Documenting the problem in the README gives a middle ground between technical and non-technical specifications. This allows organizing solutions to this challenge around community and documentation.

> [...] a beautifully crafted library with no documentation is also damn near worthless. If your software solves the wrong problem or nobody can figure out how to use it, there’s something very bad going on.
